## Purpose
This contract is used to demonstrate onchain activity and interactions on Base.
Deployed SimpleCounter contract on Base mainnet and interacted with it.
## Onchain Interaction (Base)

This repository includes a minimal example of:
- Smart contract deployment on Base mainnet
- Contract-to-contract interaction
- State mutation and read functions

Built and tested using Remix IDE and MetaMask on Base.

## Base Deployment

This repository contains a minimal smart contract example:
- Deployed on Base mainnet
- Simple state mutation via `ping()` function
- Used to demonstrate onchain activity and interaction

The contract was deployed and interacted with using Remix IDE and MetaMask.

### PingV2

PingV2 extends the original Ping contract by introducing a reset mechanism,
allowing the counter state to be cleared when needed.
